App Runner hosts Java, Node, Clojure, Python, and dotnet web-apps. After some simple set up, just push changes to the app's git repo and it will automatically be built and deployed here.

Getting started - the hard way
Step 1: Create an application
App Runner builds, deploys and runs web applications. When it starts your app, it will pass in the following environment variables:

APP_PORT - a port to host a web server on
APP_NAME - the path your web service must serve requests on, i.e. http://localhost:{APP_PORT}/{APP_NAME}/*
APP_DATA - a directory path where you can store data
TEMP - a path to a temp folder
There are a number of sample apps to get you started:

maven - Java uber jars built with maven
Apps of this kind are built and run with:
mvn clean package
java -jar target/{artifactid}-{version}.jar

nodejs - NodeJS apps with NPM dependencies
Apps of this kind are built and run with:
npm install
npm test
node server.js

lein - Clojure uber jars built with leiningen
Apps of this kind are built and run with:
lein do test, uberjar, pom
java -jar target/{artifactid}-{version}-standalone.jar

python2 - Python 2 apps with pip dependencies
Apps of this kind are built and run with:
virtualenv --python=python2 server
server/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
server/bin/python server2.py

python3 - Python 3 apps with pip dependencies
Apps of this kind are built and run with:
virtualenv --python=python3 server
server/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
server/bin/python server3.py

dotnet - .NET Core apps
Apps of this kind are built and run with:
dotnet run

Step 2: Prepare a Git Repo
Push your app to a Git server such as GitHub or an internal Git Server. App Runner needs to have read access to your repository - HTTP/HTTPS URLs should allow anonymous access. For SSH URLs, the repository needs to have the App Runner server's public key associated with it.

The public key of the App Runner server is:

ssh-rsa /K5psolcdZByNQ== apprunner
Step 3: Register and deploy your app
Both these steps can be done with the REST API:

Register
Deploy
To automatically deploy changes, set up a post-commit hook in your GIT server POSTing to /api/v1/apps/((your app name))/deploy
